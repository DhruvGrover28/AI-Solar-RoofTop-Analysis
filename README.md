# AI-Powered Rooftop Solar Analysis Tool

This tool analyzes satellite rooftop images to estimate solar installation potential, panel count, energy output, and return on investment (ROI).

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Rooftop segmentation using AI
- Panel count & power generation estimates
- Installation cost & payback period calculator
- Confidence scoring

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-rooftop-analysis
cd solar-rooftop-analysis
2. Create environment and install dependencies


pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app


streamlit run app.py
ðŸ“· Example Use Case
Input: Satellite image of a rooftop

Output:

Usable area: 120 mÂ²
